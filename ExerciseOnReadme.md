## **What I Have Learnt in The CBF Entry-To-Tech Bootcamp**
 - ## ***Week one and week two***
        
Firstly, I am excited to be part of this program and I appreciate everyone who have made my experience here so far, an 
engaging learning experience.

The CBF Entry -To-Tech bootcamp started off with a CBF X UBS mentor-student meet and greet session on zoom. 
The next lesson was Introduction to command line. I expanded my knowledge on command line commands. I viewed, handled, and 
manipulated files in ways I never did in the past. With practice I improved on my commands and how I handled data from the command-line.
     
   ## ***What I Have struggled with in week one and two***
In the first two weeks I did not have any struggles with what I was taught. The lessons were straight-forward and understandable.     

   

   - ## ***Week three***
The next lesson was introduction to git and github. The git command was understood but getting around github is quite challenging. I have 
always avoided using github in the past and only opened the account when I did, because it was floated that it was a prerequisite for programmers.
> Programmers need a github account.
> why?
> To share code and collaborate with other developers.

The concept of the synax used while writing on github was understood, but navigating around github is a task I need to master. 
> How do I overcome this challenge?   
Practice and more practice.


## ***What I Have struggled with in week three***

I found getting around github challenging.

## ***How to overcome the challenge in week three***
I intend to study, practice, reach out to my mentor and seek assistance.
