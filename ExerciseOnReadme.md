  - ###   :smiley:   ***Week one and week two***
        
Firstly, I am excited to be part of this program and I appreciate everyone who have made my experience here so far, an 
engaging learning experience.

The CBF Entry -To-Tech bootcamp started off :rocket:with a CBF X UBS mentor-student meet and greet session on zoom. 
The next lesson was Introduction to command line. I expanded my knowledge on command line commands. I viewed, handled, and 
manipulated files in ways I never did in the past. With practice I improved on my commands and how I handled data from the command-line.:nerd_face:
     
  - ### :confused:  ***What I Have struggled with in week one and two***
   
In the first two weeks of the bootcamp, I did not have any struggles with what I was taught. The lessons were straight-forward and I understood them.:dancer:     

   

 - ###   :smiley: ***Week three***
The next lesson was introduction to git and github. The git command was understood, but getting around github was quite challenging. I had
always avoided using github in the past and only opened the account, because I learned it was necessary for programmers to have an account in some cloud-based hostimg service where version control and collaboration is made easier.:alarm_clock:
> Programmers need a github account.
> why?
> One of the reasons is mentioned above. In essence, It helps developers to track and manage changes to their software code and to share code and collaborate with other developers.

The concept of the synax used while writing on github was understood, but navigating around github was a task I needed to master. :weary:
> How did I overcome this challenge? :sweat:  
The answer to that question :point_up: is Practice and more practice.


- ### :confused:  ***What I Have struggled with in week three***

I found getting around github challenging.:umbrella:

 - ### :muscle: ***How did I overcome the challenge in week three***
    - I revisited the class lessons.
    - I got more information on how to navigate github online and on the platform itself.
    - I studied, practiced and got into learning by buying courses on git and github on udemy(A learning platform).
    - I reached out to my mentor and got advice.
    - I sought assistance for technicial individuals in my circle.
 :nerd_face:

> I got more information on how to get started on github here : "[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github)"

- ###   :smiley: ***Week four***
The lessons that followed was introduction to software Development and programming principles. Both lectures were well understood.

- ### :confused:  ***What I Have struggled with in week four***

The lectures we had in week four was understood and I had no struggles.

> NOTE: My learning on github is still on-going.
