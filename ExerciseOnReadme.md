   - ## **What I Have Learnt in The CBF Entry-To-Tech Bootcamp**
Firstly, I am excited to be part of this program and I appreciate everyone who have made my experience here so far, an 
engaging learning experience.

The CBF Entry -To-Tech bootcamp started off with a CBF X UBS mentor-student meet and greet session on zoom. 
The next lesson was Introduction to command line. I expanded my knowledge on command line commands. I viewed, handled, and 
manipulated files in ways I never did in the past. With practice I improved on my commands and how I handled data from the command-line.

The next lesson was introduction to git and github. The git command was understood but getting around github is quite challenging. I have 
always avoided using github in the past and only opened the account when I did, because it was floated that it was a prerequisite for programmers.
> Programmers need a github account.
> why?
> To share code and collaborate with other developers.

> for more information see : "[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github)"

The concept of the synax used while writing on github was understood,but navigating around github is a task I need to master. 
> How do I overcome this challenge?   
Practice and more practice.

The lessons that followed was well understood.
